### Overleaf Resume Helper

This chrome extension is just a helper to upload the pdfs directly onto an endpoint without the need to manually download then upload. For example for myself, it makes updating my resume on my homepage much easier, my resume is stored in an S3, and this helper can upload to the S3 directly.
